# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I created the classes based on the three main components of the manager, the affairs, members, and the organizations.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I skimmed some example code and got a general idea of what I wanted to do.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Honestly I did more brainstorming than coding, took me about 6-8 hours once I figured out how to approach the problem.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> I'd rate this about a 7.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I did not encounter any problems in the assignment.
